# Variables in JavaScript

Variables are containers for storing data values. JavaScript provides three ways to declare variables:

## Declaration Keywords

### 1. var (Function Scoped)
- Older way of declaring variables
- Function scoped or globally scoped
- Can be re-declared and updated
- Hoisted to the top

### 2. let (Block Scoped)
- Modern way to declare variables
- Block scoped
- Cannot be re-declared in the same scope
- Can be updated

### 3. const (Block Scoped)
- Used for constants
- Block scoped
- Cannot be re-declared or updated
- Must be initialized at declaration

## Best Practices
- Use `const` by default
- Use `let` when you need to reassign
- Avoid `var` in modern JavaScript
